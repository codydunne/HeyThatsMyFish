# VisConnect My Fish

*VisConnect My Fish!* is a short and fun game based on the *Hey, That's My Fish!* board game. It is meant as an example of the live collaboration enabled by [VisConnect](https://visconnect.us/), which syncronizes events such as mouse clicks and drags across collaborators. Please see the homepage and [the VisConnect paper from IEEE VIS 2020](https://osf.io/ut7e6/) to learn more.
